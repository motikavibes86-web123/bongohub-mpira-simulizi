# BongoVibe (Next.js + Tailwind)

This repo was bootstrapped with a minimal Next.js + Tailwind setup and the BongoVibe UI component.

To run locally:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

Add your Gemini API key to `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` to enable Bongo AI.

Deploy to Vercel: push to the `main` branch and Vercel will detect Next.js automatically.

Please commit directly to branch main. Skip creating/overwriting src/components/BongoVibeFinal.tsx. Thank you.
